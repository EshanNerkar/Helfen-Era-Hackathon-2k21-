     <h1>Our Approach</h1> 
  
    <div>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Poverty has been an issue faced by India for quite some time now. This is mainly due to illiteracy,the exponentially increasing 
        population and also the unemployment.Due to which some people are deprived of their basic needs and this causes  more illiteracy 
        and also causes the  gap between the rich and poor to increase .</p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">According to us, these basic needs such as food, shelter and education 
        are every individual’s rights,these rights make them empowered in the long term.So, we have decided to take up this social cause and have made 
        some efforts to decrease the poverty index.
        Our aim is that every person  can get these basic facilities,and get themselves a better standard 
        of living.</p>
         <p style="font-size: x-large;">Our website,Helfen Era has taken up this challenge to  associate people with organizations which will provide every people in need 
        a shelter ,food,education and a better way of living..Here, we welcome all the sponsors and volunteers to lend their helping hand in this
         social cause...So, we can  make India economically and socially strong again . As we know, malnutrition is also an issue caused by lack of 
         proper nutrition and food. Whereas  5-star restaurants waste a large amount of food on a daily basis.So,we have decided that this extra food 
         could be made available to the needy by our volunteers where we shall act as a medium between these organizations. We have some governmental 
         and non governmental organisations supporting this campaign .
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;"> We will be acting as an intermediary between the organizations and poor people so that no individual gets deprived of these basic amenities.
        The sponsors will be providing  funds, and also, on their level, they shall help these  people , and make sure that  all of the amount they 
        are pitching in is utilized in providing food,shelter and education to  the poor.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;  ">Children of today are the adults of tomorrow. It is these children who will shape the future of India. It is therefore imperative that
             every last child in India gets a healthy and fair start in life. Educating children will go a long way in empowering them to grow 
             into skilled, mature and capable adults who can contribute better to their own and society’s welfare.Hence, we will try 
             connecting these children with these organizations  and provide them with the best education possible,so that they get a better 
             tomorrow . This is because money can’t eradicate poverty but education definitely can.This  way we are  trying to get rid of 
             poverty,by,making everyone self-sufficient so they can get a better life and adapt a better standard of living.We accept all the 
             people who want to voluntarily participate and donate in this social concerns so we emerge as a stronger nation .
